────────────────────────
ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS
────────────────────────
• Use recent SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), earnings data, and credible industry sources  
• Include multi-year revenue, margins, losses/profits, cash flow, and balance-sheet trends  
• Break out segment-level performance where applicable  
• Detail capital structure: cash, debt, leases, converts, equity issuance, dilution  
• Explicitly analyze backlog, customer concentration, and revenue visibility  
• Identify execution risk, financing risk, and operating leverage  

────────────────────────
VALUATION FRAMEWORK
────────────────────────
Evaluate valuation using:
• Market cap, enterprise value
• P/E, EV/EBITDA (even if negative)
• Sales multiples
• Book value and P/B
• Simple intrinsic value or DCF sanity check if FCF is negative

Anchor valuation to **margin of safety**.
State clearly whether the equity is:
– Fundamentally undervalued  
– Fairly priced with optionality  
– Speculatively priced with thin downside protection  


────────────────────────
📐 INVESTMENT THEORY ANALYSIS
────────────────────────
Analyze the equity through **two classical investment frameworks**.
Assign explicit weights and justify them using the metrics above.

#### Firm Foundation Theory
Briefly explain how intrinsic value, cash flow, profitability, and capital efficiency apply to $TICKER.
Emphasize:
• ROIC
• ROE
• Free Cash Flow
• Net Income trends

State whether fundamentals support intrinsic value.
Assign a weight out of 100%.

#### Castle-in-the-Air Theory
Briefly explain how market psychology, momentum, or narrative may be driving valuation.
Emphasize:
• Weighted Alpha
• Valuation multiples expansion
• Flows or sentiment indicators (if available)

State whether price action is decoupled from fundamentals.
Assign a weight out of 100%.

#### Why This Investment Fits
Synthesize both theories.
Explicitly state:
• Which framework dominates
• Whether the stock is fundamentally justified, sentiment-driven, or balanced
• The implication for downside risk and timing

Conclude with:
**Overall Lean: Firm Foundation / Castle-in-the-Air / Balanced**


────────────────────────
MOAT & COMPETITION
────────────────────────
• Identify the moat type (scale, technology, regulation, integration, or none)
• Compare against direct and indirect competitors
• Distinguish between **realized moat** and **future/optional moat**
• Be explicit about where pricing power does or does not exist

────────────────────────
🧾 INSIDER & INSTITUTIONAL ACTIVITY
────────────────────────
Summarize recent insider, institutional, and political trading activity for $TICKER during $QUARTER.

## 🧾 Insider & Institutional Activity — $TICKER | $QUARTER

| Entity Type     | Action       | Date & Time (ET)       | Details & Strategic Tags |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Insider         | Buy/Sell     | YYYY-MM-DD @ HH:MM      | Shares, price, conviction |
| Institution     | Accumulate/Trim | YYYY-MM-DD @ HH:MM   | Filing type, % change |
| Congress        | Buy/Sell     | YYYY-MM-DD @ HH:MM      | Size, optics, signal |

Interpret activity as:
• Confirmatory
• Contradictory
• Neutral

If no activity exists, explicitly state:
**“No recent insider or institutional activity detected.”**

────────────────────────
CATALYSTS & TIMELINE
────────────────────────
Lay out identifiable catalysts across:
• Near-term (0–6 months)
• Medium-term (6–18 months)
• Long-term (2–5 years)

Tie each catalyst to financial impact or valuation implications.

────────────────────────
RISKS & INVALIDATION
────────────────────────
• List concrete business, financial, and execution risks
• Define explicit **thesis-invalidation triggers**
• Avoid vague risk language
• Tie risks to cash flow, solvency, or valuation compression

────────────────────────
STYLE CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────
• Neutral, analytical tone
• No hype or promotional language
• No retail framing
• Treat the stock as a financial asset, not a mission
• Explicitly acknowledge uncertainty where it exists
• Cite sources using bracketed references [1], [2], etc. (no hyperlinks)

────────────────────────
FINAL LENS
────────────────────────
Conclude implicitly by answering:
Is this a high-quality business at a poor price,
or a fragile business supported by optionality?
